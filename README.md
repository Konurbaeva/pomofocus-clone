This project is about timer

I have learned how to create a simple timer using JavaScript. The code uses the querySelector method to select elements from the HTML document and assign them to variables. It also uses the setInterval method to update the timer every second.

The code defines several functions, including pad, which is used to add a leading zero to numbers less than 10, startTimer, which starts the timer interval, stopTimer, which stops the timer interval, resetTimer, which resets the timer to its initial state, and incrementTimer, which increments the timer by one second.

Finally, the code adds event listeners to the start, stop, and reset buttons, which call the corresponding functions when clicked.
